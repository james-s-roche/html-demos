## 📄 Repository for Hosted Resources (GitHub Pages)

This repository is specifically designed to host static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, PDFs, etc.) using **GitHub Pages**.

The primary purpose is to provide a stable, publicly accessible URL for resources that need to be linked or embedded elsewhere, such as:

* **Custom HTML content** (e.g., small tools, widgets, single-page sites).
* **Images or media files** for external blogs, documentation, or applications.
* **Static documentation** or user guides.
* **Assets** for personal projects or experiments.
